In the 0.0.3 version I've made some changes comparing to the original build:

1. General polishing

2. Minor bugs fixed

3. New effects:
- Camera shake animation
- On hit sounds for enemies
- On hit particle effects for enemies
- Death slowmotion effect

4. New content:
- Health powerups to replenish player's health
- New projectile type that shots to the player's location rather than just straight forward



More stuff will be added in future. The current build is available in \Builds\0.0.3\
